# Analytics Package

<!-- 
  OWNERSHIP STATUS:
  
  codeowners library reports: @analytics-team (correct - specific pattern)
  GitHub actually assigns:     @analytics-team (correct)
  
  Pattern: /packages/analytics @analytics-team
  
  This file has a specific ownership pattern, so both the library and GitHub
  handle it correctly. The bug only affects wildcard /* patterns.
